My name is Shizuka Kamishima. I'm a writer, programmer, and gamer living in
the north suburbs of the Twin Cities, Minnesota. I spend most of my time
at Bronystate as a community manager, interacting with the IRC channel
almost constantly. I also oversee staff projects to improve the quality of
the site. I've been doing this for almost four years.

In April 2014, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, after a couple weeks
of intense illness. This gave me a better appreciation for the time I have,
and I've spent it helping everyone I meet online. In January 2015, after
*many* years of soul-searching, I came out as transgender to my friends and
family. The response was deeply uplifting, and I've done my best to be
more outgoing and open since.

I like music without lyrics, that can be run on shuffle-repeat in Winamp
for hours at a time in the background. Most of my library is game
soundtracks, all thrown together into one big random playlist. My gaming
interests are more about story and immersion than mechanics and hard
gameplay. I hold a deep admiration for the Myst series, and relish getting
lost in the worlds of The Elder Scrolls. With other players I vastly prefer
cooperative games to competitive ones. Things are more fun when you're
working with your friends, rather than against them.

# what is this vortal cord?

Everyone has a site. You aren't really a citizen of the internet until you
have a place you can call home. For years I've operated a server out of my
bedroom, mostly to tinker with, try to learn some Linux. Its main purpose
is to play host to my IRC client, for logging and a constant presence in
the channel. The ability to serve pages, or games, is a bonus.

This is the fifth generation of my personal site. The first was a barebones
html with a few links to other projects. The second was a GetSimple CMS
installation, where I discovered markdown and the wonders it does for
writing site content. It wasn't perfect, and so the third generation I
tried using DokuWiki. This firmly established my color styleguide for the
site, but wrangling the template took so much time I had no interest left
to actually fill in content. Fourth generation Vortal Cord I built myself
on top of CodeIgniter, taking the time to properly learn PHP, and do my
best at keeping presentation and logic separate. The controller was a
complete mess, but it worked.

And a couple years later, following my server's sudden distaste for booting
up, I have the fifth generation, built with Jekyll, hosted on Github
Pages. Turns out Jekyll is precisely what I was reinventing with Vortal
Cord v4: plain text markdown files, linking to each other by hand, inserted
into a consistent template. Only this time, hosting on Github Pages, I
skip entirely the step of uploading to the server; just push the raw files,
and they do the rest. I hope to get my server up and running again soon,
but when I do I'll be glad not to have to host my site out of it, and can
use that memory for other things.

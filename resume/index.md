## [Bronystate][brst] / Technical Supervisor / 2011-present {#brst}

Bronystate is an IRC community born from the *My Little Pony: Friendship is
Magic* fandom, started in May 2011. Their focus is video streaming, with
movies on the weekends and live streams of new episodes during the season.
They boast a vibrant community from all over the world, and reach tens of
thousands of users.

### Highlights

- Built and deployed Wordpress installation for long-delayed site upgrade
- Wrote [Wordpress plugin][brstemb] to handle details for multiple stream
  sources, and user-friendly method of changing which source is live to the
  public
- Compiled [backlog of movies][brstbak] shown with another site's archive
  of Bronystate newsletters, IMDB, and Google Sheets
- Deployed LimeSurvey for weekly newsletter and movie night voting
- Deployed DokuWiki for staff and moderator documentation
- Created Google Group mailing list for staff communication
- Produced Tom Awards Show in [2012][tom2012] and [2013][tom2013], a
  community-chosen list of best movies, episodes, and other categories,
  narrated by staff
- Produced [intermission][brstint] video for use during movie nights
- Routinely host game servers for community game nights
- Frequently stream content at all hours to a wide audience
- Constantly interact with diverse community over IRC

## [World of Minecraft][wom] / Moderator / 2010-2011 {#wom}

World of Minecraft was a Minecraft Classic server network, before the
introduction of survival multiplayer to the Alpha version of the game. They
maintained several themed servers (a city skyline, a big flat box, rolling
hills, etc) that attracted many talented builders. The IRC community fell
apart in late 2011, and the site legacy was carried on by some former
staff.

### Highlights

- Oversaw hundreds of users in unlimited sandbox Minecraft Classic
- Used staff inspection tools to revert damage to user creations
- Interacted with regular community members in IRC

## [Goon Haven][gh] / Community Architect / 2009-2011 {#gh}

Goon Haven, now Gamer Haus, was one of several server communities to spring
up shortly after the release of [TribesNext][tn] in early 2009. It was
started by a group of SomethingAwful users (goons) but rapidly grew to
consistently be the most populated server in the list. I was approached due
to my extended presence on the server (having not much else to do right out
of high school).

### Highlights

- Monitored 64 players at once for periods of several hours
- High player turnover required rapid action
- Established clear rules for the community, which stayed in place long
  after I left
- Established community IRC channel, including channel operator permissions
- Helped in testing of new gamemode mods
- Helped in testing bot to periodically print server status to IRC

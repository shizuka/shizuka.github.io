### Technical Supervisor / 2011-present

Bronystate is an IRC community for the *My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic*

![World of Minecraft front page](wom-frontpage.png)

## [World of Minecraft](http://www.worldofminecraft.com) {#wom}

### Moderator / 2010-2011

World of Minecraft was a Minecraft Classic server network, before the addition
of multiplayer to the Alpha version of the game. They maintained several servers
that attracted many talented builders. During peak hours, there would be
hundreds of players from around the world.

The IRC community fell apart in late 2011, and the site legacy was carried on by
some former staff. It exists today as a community focused on one server.

#### Highlights
 - Oversaw hundreds of simultaneous users in Minecraft Classic
 - Used staff inspection tools to detect and revert damage to user creations
 - Interacted with regular community members on IRC

![Gamer Haus forums](gh-forums.png)

## [Goon Haven](http://gamer.haus) {#goonhaven}

### Community Architect / 2009-2010

Goon Haven was one of several Tribes 2 server communities to appear shortly
after the release of TribesNext in early 2009, rapidly becoming the most
consistently populated server in the list for the duration of the game's
revival.

When Tribes 2's popularity declined between 2010-2012, the site rebranded as
Gamer Haus and branched out to hosting other games and groups. The site exists
now as a frontend for their Discord chat server.

#### Highlights
 - Fast-paced game server administration of up to 64 simultaneous players
 - Established clear community rules, which remained long after my departure
 - Founded community IRC channel, including setup of IRC services
 - Helped testing IRC bot that integrated with game server
 - Helped testing experimental Tribes 2 game mods

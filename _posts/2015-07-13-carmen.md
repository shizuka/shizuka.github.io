It's been much too long since I wrote something up, and having finally navigated
the setup for DOSBox I decided to take another look at ***Carmen Sandiego*** on
CD. I don't remember where or when I got it -- it's one of those CDs that's just
been in my collection forever -- but I do remember getting it up and running
in the early 2000s on my Win98 box. No music, sound worked, but I was ten and
the Internet wasn't a thing for me, so I never finished a single case.

Rather hard to follow the suspect when your clues say they went somewhere that
leads the world in *cloves* exports, and you don't even know what cloves *are*
yet.

I completely missed the DOS game era, and most of the early PC games in fact. By
the time I had a computer of my own, with Windows 98 able to run DOS games no
problem, I was already used to the modern experience of games. Double click exe,
game runs, sound and midi happily chirping away. With DOS, suddenly everything
had a strange command line installer, and a setup program asking you for the IRQ
setting on your sound card. And why didn't picking SoundBlaster work when my
Windows audio settings told me I had a Creative SoundBlaster card?

***Carmen***, I suppose, released at the right time in DOS game history, with a
competent auto-setup installer that could at least detect wave support, and get
the game running fullscreen. Shame I was too young and too alone to make much
use of it. When I wanted geography gaming, I went over to Encarta MindMaze.

So it sat in my spindle of CD games, alongside things like ***Bodyland***, one
of those "wow this CD thing lets us do *MULTIMEDIA*" childrens' learning apps,
and ***Midnight Rescue!***, one of the *Super Solvers* titles. 

A decade and a half later, I've ripped ISOs of what few CDs aren't scratched
beyond repair, and decided to have another go at ***Carmen***. One DOSBox Game
Launcher install later, and it's up and running, no problems. Armed with Google
and Wikipedia, no criminal can hide from me!

When I wrote the [Vortex95](2015-05-25-vortex95.html) review, I was under the
delusion I would be able to port it to a browser game, despite not knowing the
first thing about modern Javascript programming. That's still the case, the
not-knowing-Javascript part, because I'm just not that good thinking about
pixels. ***Vortex95*** would require understanding a lot of graphics calls, to
draw the board, and the lanes, and the pieces, and handling mouse events to move
pieces, and wrapping my brain and the player's around the scoring, and, and...

But ***Carmen Sandiego***? Much simpler in comparison. Build a fixed size box
page, have a big fixed block for the location image, a few blocks for the phone,
text box for the transcripts and general UI, and some UI for the notepad.

So it's another "hey this would be a neat idea" idea. There's still a lot to do,
but it's mostly data generation. The original game has 45 cities, each with some
artifact to steal, and most everything else could be procedurally generated --
which cities can be accessed from this point, what path does the perp take, what
locations can be searched in a city, and so on. Writing a lot of copy is easier
than wrapping my head around pixel drawing.

So maybe something will come of this idea. Or maybe I still won't make any
progress on it, and a couple months from now I'll dig up another old game that's
even simpler to implement in a browser.
